Q1: How to treat NaN values in valence and arousel
A1: You could do two things: just take the average of the day and assign that to your NaN
    Or
    Use nearest neighbours (you get more points)

Q2: We have very skewed distibutions, so the IQR method is not helpful, what do we do?
A2: Normalize data 

Q3: With what do we replace the outliers?
A3: Replace with NaN and use same method as Q1 ^

Q4: We are going to predict the average mood on the next day. So we will aggregate (taking the average) of the mood per day.  
    However, for valence and arousal for example, taking the average will not result in an integer [-2,2]. What do we need to do?
A4: First make an correlogram to see which variables are highly correlated with mood. Then decide which one to keep.
    (he said valence and arousal weren't highly correlated). 

Notes:
First make a correlogram to decide which features to keep (note that you cannot use a correlogram for categorial and numerical attributes). 
Then once you have decided which ones to keep, decide which ones to aggregate. 


- 2 manieren van missing value interpolation (knn means wordt nu gebruikt)
- stratified split 
- recurrent neural network
- outlier correction (verwijderen / voor of na aggregatie / ...)

om te varieren in de hele pipeline:
- hoeveel SelectKBest
- missing values hoe invullen of verwijderen
- window of aggregation
- modellen vergelijken
- feature selection misschien mee spelen

TODO:
- in df_to_features_and_targets, plot_pacf voor iedere user voor mood
- RNN fit optimaliseren (cross validations, epochs, hidden dimensions, etc.), slechte performence
- scatter plot van predictions opslaan
- distribution figuur mood
- nan waardes na dag aggregatie plotten (?)

- windows van 4 en 8 geprobeert, niet relevant, windows weglaten
- ignore nan in skew calculation circumplex.valence/arousal
